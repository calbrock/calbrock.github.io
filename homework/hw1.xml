    <paragrah number= "2"><b>CALL</b> me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
       </paragrah>
    <paragraph>There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

        The sweet frangipane filling with almon is a lovely addiction and really brings these little tarts to whole new flavour level.

     <steps>Prehear the oven to 200 &#176; C. Place the pastry
     on a lined oven tray to thaw. Cut 1 sheet into 
     4 squares and prick all over with a fork to 
     stop it puffing up too much and other one I
     choose to have it as a round circle.
     
     
     For a frangipane filling, cream the sugar
     and butter together until light. Add egg
     and mix to combine. Finally add the
     almonds, extract to combine
     
     
     Spread the frangipane evenly into the
     pufff pastry sheets leaving 1 cm from the
     edges. Arrange the apples slices in a 
     pretty petal pattern.
     
     
     Brush with melted butter and sprinkle
     with the extra sugar. Bake for about 20-25
     minutes till the pastry is puffed and
     golden around the edges.
     Drizzle with honey and serve with dollop
     of double cream</steps>
