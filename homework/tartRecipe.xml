            The sweet frangipane filling with almon is a lovely addiction and really brings these little tarts to whole new flavour level.

    <steps>Prehear the oven to 200 &#176; C. Place the pastry
        on a lined oven tray to thaw. Cut 1 sheet into 
        4 squares and prick all over with a fork to 
        stop it puffing up too much and other one I
        choose to have it as a round circle.
        
        
        For a frangipane filling, cream the sugar
        and butter together until light. Add egg
        and mix to combine. Finally add the
        almonds, extract to combine
        
        
        Spread the frangipane evenly into the
        pufff pastry sheets leaving 1 cm from the
        edges. Arrange the apples slices in a 
        pretty petal pattern.
        
        
        Brush with melted butter and sprinkle
        with the extra sugar. Bake for about 20-25
        minutes till the pastry is puffed and
        golden around the edges.
        Drizzle with honey and serve with dollop
        of double cream</steps>
